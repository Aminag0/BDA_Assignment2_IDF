# Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation

This repository contains scripts for calculating the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) based on the Term Frequency (TF) and document counts.

## Introduction

The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is a measure used in information retrieval to indicate the importance of a term within a collection of documents. It quantifies the rarity of a term across documents, with higher values indicating that the term is less common and more informative.

## Usage

To use the scripts provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Input Files**: Ensure you have the following input files:
   - `tf.txt`: File containing Term Frequency (TF) information.
   - `document_count.txt`: File containing document counts.
   - `created_vocabulary.txt`: File containing the created vocabulary.

2. **Execute Mapper Script**:
   - Run the `mapper_idf.py` script to generate intermediate data:
     ```
     cat tf.txt document_count.txt created_vocabulary.txt | ./mapper_idf.py | sort > intermediate_output.txt
     ```

3. **Execute Reducer Script**:
   - Run the `reducer_idf.py` script to compute IDF values:
     ```
     cat intermediate_output.txt | ./reducer_idf.py > idf_output.txt
     ```

4. **Output**:
   - The `idf_output.txt` file will contain the computed IDF values for each term.

## Files

- `mapper_idf.py`: Mapper script to process input files and emit intermediate data.
- `reducer_idf.py`: Reducer script to compute IDF values.
- `README.md`: This README file providing instructions and information about the repository.
